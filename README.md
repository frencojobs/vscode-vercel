## Setup

Simply set vercel-vscode.AccessToken to the value gotten by going to [https://vercel.com/account/tokens](https://vercel.com/account/tokens) and clicking create.

## Features

Here is a list of features the extension currently supports.

- ðŸ“œ View deployment & their details (with dedicated side bar)
- âœ… View (real-time) logs with a webview
- ðŸ”Ž Filter the deployment statuses based on teams & projects

This is an updated version of [frencojobs' vscode-vercel](https://github.com/frencojobs/vscode-vercel)

## Important!

I can not and am not promising repairation of any features that were broken in the original. I only updated the authentication script to get the token from settings.json instead of the now depreciated Oauth V2 provided by Vercel.

I have not, and don't plan to, attempted to repair the display of the logs, I am simply bringing life back to an old, yet, useful extension. If you would like to fix problems, such as the above, please feel free to fork this repo and submit a pull request.
